A wheeled storage platform, with chain driven vertical mast and simple hydraulic tilt mechanism, alongside framework for removable carriage and tyne system

This project is a simple, robust mechanical design, incorperating basic load estimation. It is intended as a real, buildable system and is designed with a high safety factor.

## Overview
- Chain-driven vertical lift mechanism
- Steel frame with guided carriage
- Caster wheels for mobility
- Simple Worm gear based hand drill drive
- Designed for static loads up to 1000kg (with safety factor)

### NOTE
This system is NOT designed for lifting of people or animals, load ratings assume relatively large static mass

## Repository Structure
- docs/ Design reasonings, references
- cad/ CAD files, assemblies, STEP files
- calculations/ load estimates, hand calculations regarding safety and mechanical stress
- manufacturing/ notes regarding the creation of parts and assembly of product
- media/ 3d renders, photos regarding prototypes

## Status
Work in progress
