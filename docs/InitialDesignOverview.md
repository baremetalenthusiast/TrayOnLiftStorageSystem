## Purpose & requirements

### How heavy will you lift? How often?

Max Load of approx 700kg (+100kg as maximum theoretical)

- 750kg, lifting once per week

### Max lift height?

- height of trayon 1250-1300
- height of ute tray 1000-1100 off ground
- legs of tray on can extend to lift tray on clear off tray
- legs of trayon can lower trayon to min distance off ground 660


### Is it manual or motorized?

Manual with option for hand drill

### What’s the workspace footprint?

2400x2200

## Constraints

### Weight, space, budget

- weight, should be easy to push around when no load attached. 
- preferably can be stored under the trayon when not in use. 
- $300-$400 

### Safety

### Parts availability (chains, sprockets, motors)

## Design options

### Lift mechanism: chain, cable, scissor, lead screw?

chain driven

### Drive

Worm drive driven by geared system with attachment for a hand drill

### Frame material & structure: steel, aluminum?

box steel

## Safety considerations

### Maximum load vs working load limit (WLL)

### Redundancy / fail-safe elements

### Guards and stops
