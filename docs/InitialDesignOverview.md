## Purpose & requirements

### How heavy will you lift? How often?

Max Load of approx 700kg (+100kg as maximum theoretical)

### Max lift height?



### Is it manually or motorized?

### What’s the workspace footprint?

## Constraints

### Weight, space, budget

### Safety (you’re lifting real loads)

### Parts availability (chains, sprockets, motors)

## Design options

### Lift mechanism: chain, cable, scissor, lead screw?

### Drive: manual, motorized (DC motor, stepper)?

### Frame material & structure: steel, aluminum?

## Safety considerations

### Maximum load vs working load limit (WLL)

### Redundancy / fail-safe elements

### Guards and stops
