| Component | Function | Load / Requirement | Source / Notes | Quantity/Length |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chain | Drive the carriage up and down the mast | (client specification) | Prototype build: Engine chain/salvage | TBD frame design |
| Sprocket | Couple the chains together, link to the worm drive | pitch matching chain, load rated for (client spec), WLL on teeth for torque applied | Prototype Build: old engine/motorbike. Finished Product: off the shelf rated product | 2 (4? depends on loadmax) |
| Shaft | Couple sprocket to worm drive | Torque rated for force coming off of sprocket/drive. Tout​=Tworm​×Gear Ratio×η | Steel round bar, must be solid + rated to torque | TBD frame design |
| Worm Drive | Provide mechanical leverage to lift carriage+load up and down mast | Manufacturer SPEC:<br>Rated output torque<br>Maximum static torque<br>Back-driving torque (if self-locking) | Tough to trace down salvage, will need to purchase off of shelf | 1 (1 spare?) |
| Sprocket Shaft Coupling | Robust connection between sproket and worm drive | Torque rated | Could even be a welded joint? | 1 |
| Bearings | allow for smooth rotation and fastening of rotating parts to frame | Rotational speed relatively low, rated for downforce | Purchased or salvaged from trailer, are not a main factor | 5 |
| Box Steel | construction of frame | σ=IM⋅c​ (bending equation) δ=F⋅L^3/3⋅E⋅I (deflection check)​ | Salvage from junkyard and/or purchased from steel supplier | TBD (length calculated from frame design |
| Caster Wheels | allow for frame to be moved by hand or vehicle without being lifted | (client specification) | Purchased online or through bunnings | 4 |
| Carriage/Forks | Lift load directly and transfer force to system | (client specification) | Provided by client | 1 |
| Rollers (alternative is T slot, questionable precision, questionable smooth linear motion) | Slot into mast to constrain linear motion to vertical as determined by mast | TBD mast specs | Fabricated or purchased from steel | 4 (TBD based on mast design) |
| Fastenings | Bolts nuts and washers to fasten parts that are not welded | TBD specs of frame | Salvage + bulk purchase | TBD |
| Safety Stops | End stops to prevent carriage or other moving parts from coming loose/causing damage | TBD specs of frame | Fabricated from spare steel | TBD |
